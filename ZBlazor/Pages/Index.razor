<h1>Blazor ZMachine Player</h1>

<p>
    This simple site uses a C# ZMachine byte code interpreter running under WebAssembly in your browser.
</p>
<p>
    The programs listed on the left are not hosted by this site. There are retrieved on page load from the <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource">Historical Source github archive</a> and as such they may or may not work as they do not represent actual released programs but rather the last version of files from a hard-drive just before the company shutdown 20+ years ago.
</p>
See the archive readme file (i.e. the <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">Zork I</a> entry) for more details.
